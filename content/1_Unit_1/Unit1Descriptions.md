## Introduction to Engineering â€“ Dual Enrollment (1 Semester)

### **Course Description** 

This course is designed to introduce the profession, ethics, and diversity of the field of engineering to students in their first year of high school.  The course will allow students to explore the 10 primary concentrations within engineering by listening to guest speaker lectures, working on an interactive project with a team, and presenting the results of their project to the class.  The majors are: Biological Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Computer Engineering/ Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Construction Management, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Petroleum Engineering.  Specifically, this course will emphasize that the engineer is a team worker who needs strong skills in technical problem solving, engineering design, ethical decision making, and communicating to diverse audiences.  

### Course Objectives

* Demonstrate an understanding of academic honesty and ethics pertaining to the profession of engineers

* Demonstrate effective communication skills, through team working, oral presentations, and good written communication

* Demonstrate an awareness of the connections between engineering and the wider world

* Use the engineering design process to create, test, and redesign discipline specific projects to gain better appreciation of the diverse engineering fields

## Unit 1: Ethics and the Field of Engineering (210-270 minutes)

This unit introduces students to the course and teaches them about the importance of ethics in engineering.

### Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes):  

**In this lesson students will take a survey and a pre-test to determine prior knowledge.  After, this lesson will go over the overall format of the class, the syllabus and classroom policies.  This lesson will also teach students what engineering is and what engineers do. **

#### 	Outcomes

* Discuss the overall format of the class

* Define engineering and what engineers do

* Describe what some engineering disciplines do 

* Enumerate several career paths for engineers

### **Lesson 2 (150-180 minutes): **

**This lesson will teach students about ethical decision making through hands on projects.**

#### Outcomes

* Demonstrate an understanding of academic honesty ethics, and ethics pertaining to the profession of engineer

* Gain a better understanding of the variety of factors that influence and cloud a person's judgement when faced with an ethical dilemma

* Understand the bases for making ethical decisions

* Analyze and debate multiple solutions to an ethical dilemma, determine the best alternative available, and describe how the decision maximizes the benefit and minimizes the risk for everyone involved

### **Lesson 3 (30 minutes): **

**Quiz on the unit**

#### Outcomes

* Check for understanding

Unit 1 - Lesson 1

## Unit 2: Communication, Teamwork, and Work Ethic (210-270 minutes)

This unit teaches students about work ethic, communication, and teamwork through lectures and interactive projects.

### **Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes): **This lesson will teach students about effective communication and teamwork. 

Outcomes

## Unit 3: Engineering Design Process (210-270 minutes)

This unit introduces students to the engineering design process and involves them in creative problem solving.

### **Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes)**: This lesson aims at introducing students to the engineering design process.

Outcomes 

* Learn how design impacts product performance

* Understand the difference in an innovation and an invention

* Identify and describe the parts of the engineering design process

### **Lesson 2 (150-180 minutes)**: Students use the engineering design process in creative problem solving.

Outcomes 

* Use the engineering design process to solve the problem

* Employ the use of data collection and analysis to help solve the problem

* Explain the reasons for their selected designs and material choices

### **Lesson 3 (30 minutes): **Quiz on the unit

Outcomes

* Check for understanding

## Unit 4-13: One Unit in Each of Ten Engineering Disciplines (210-270 minutes)

Each of these units teaches students about one of the ten primary fields of engineering. Students will hear a guest presentation about the opportunities available in each field of engineering.  Students will then complete a hands on project related to each field of engineering.  Students will present the results of their project, write a lab report and take a quiz related that particular field of engineering.  The ten fields of engineering are: Biological Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Construction Management, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Petroleum Engineering.

### **Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes)**: This lesson in each unit teaches students about each field of engineering and the career options available after graduation. This can be in the form of a guest speaker or video on the particular field of engineering.

Outcomes 

* Interact with a STEM professional

* Demonstrate an awareness of the connections between each field of engineering and the wider world.

### **Lesson 2 (150-180 minutes)**: This lesson teaches students about working in teams to complete a project related to each field of engineering.

Outcomes 

* Conduct design based projects to gain better appreciation of each field of engineering.

* Demonstrate effective communication skills, through team working, oral presentations, and good written communication.

### **Lesson 3 (30 minutes): **Quiz on the unit

Outcomes

* Check for understanding
