**Suggested Materials**: you can use any of the following materials to make a super slinger. You do not need ALL of the materials to complete this assignment. 

* Cardboard (enough for the base of your slinging mechanism)

* Ping-pong ball

* Masking tape

* String

* Plastic Spoons (launcher)

* Pencils 

* Plastic Cups

* Rubber bands

* Paper clips

* Mouse Trap

**Procedure**:

1. Use any of the materials above to create a catapult that launches a ping pong ball at least 5 feet. 

2. Once you have finished creating the catapult, launch three different times. 

3. Record your distance in the chart below. 

**Results**:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Trial </td>
    <td>Distance (feet)</td>

</table>


**Discussion Questions**:

1. **Torque** is the amount of force (N) multiplied by the length (in) of your launcher. Calculate the torque of your super slinger by measuring the length of your launcher from the pivot point to the end. Assume that the force for a mousetrap is 100 N or each rubber band is 5 N. Assume that the mass of the ball does not impact the torque.

2. How could you increase the torque of your super slinger? What would increasing torque do to the distance of your launch?

3. Explain how you went through each step of the engineering design process while completing this lab by providing examples of what you did to create your super slinger. Use at least one sentence per step in your explanation.
