## Unit Objectives

Each of these units teaches students about one of the ten primary fields of engineering. Students will hear a guest presentation about the opportunities available in each field of engineering.  Students will then complete a hands on project related to each field of engineering.  Students will present the results of their project, write a lab report and take a quiz related that particular field of engineering.  The ten fields of engineering are: Biological Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Construction Management, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Petroleum Engineering.

### Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes)
