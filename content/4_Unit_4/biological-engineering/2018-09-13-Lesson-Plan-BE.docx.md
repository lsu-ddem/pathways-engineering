# **Unit: **Biological Engineering

## **Primary Subject Area and Grade Level:** 9-10

## Overview

This unit teaches students about the field of biological engineering. Students will hear a guest presentation about the opportunities available in the field of biological engineering.  Students will then complete a hands on project related to biological engineering.  Students will present the results of their project, write a lab report and take a quiz related biological engineering.

### Outcomes

1. Demonstrate an awareness of the connections between biological engineering and the wider world.

2. Conduct design based projects to gain better appreciation of biological engineering.

3. Demonstrate effective communication skills through teamwork, oral presentations, and good written communication.

### Expected Lesson Duration

210 to 270 minutes

### Materials

Specified in each day's lesson. 

### Preparing to teach

Specified in each day's lesson. 

### Learning Activities

Specified in each day's lesson.

### Student Handouts

Provided for each lesson.

### Implementation Feedback

A reflection should be completed at the end of each lesson.

### Relevance/Rationale/Explorations and Extensions

                                           	

Biological engineering is one of many engineering fields.  It is one of ten primary engineering majors offered at Louisiana State University.  Learning about the type of work done by biological engineers and executing a project allows the students to see if biological engineering is a possible career choice that they would like to pursue in greater depth. 

### Assessment Criteria for Success:

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. Student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via discussion based questions, project presentations, lab report, peer evaluations, and quizzes. Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of biological engineering can be observed through their own work and their peers' work.
