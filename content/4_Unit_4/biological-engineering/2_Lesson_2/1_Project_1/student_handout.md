Playground Design Project
test

**Materials**

Each group needs:



*   1 Poster board
*   Paper, pencil, markers
*   Tape or adhesive 
*   Computer

**Activity**

Today you and your team will design a playground for an assigned age range of school children. 

The design should include:



*   age appropriate equipment
*   methods to access the structure
*   consideration of appropriate surfacing
    *   You should be able to explain your logic for selecting surfacing based on their deck/platform heights and spacing of equipment.  
*   number of kids that can play on the playground
*   the size of the playground
*   costs of the playground.  To calculate cost per square foot, divide the purchase price of a playground by its total square footage. For instance, if a playground with 2,000 square feet sells for $180,000, the cost per square foot is $90 per square foot. 

You should use the Engineering Design Process to come up with a suitable design and be able to explain why you have selected the equipment that you've selected. Once you have come up with the design, you should lay it out on the poster board provided by your teacher. 

At a minimum, the poster should include:



*   A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">basic sketch</span> (hand drawn or computer generated) of the layout of their playground design indicating the equipment selected.  It may also include computer pictures/graphics of specific equipment.
*   Safety considerations (i.e. how to avoid sharp points, corners, edges, tripping hazards, entrapment, etc…). The use of bullet points is advised.
*   Mention the surfacing and equipment selection and why you choose the surfacing and specific equipment.  The use of bullet points is advised. 

**Communication and Testing**



1.  Prepare a 1-2 minute presentation giving a snapshot of your design. 
1.  Write lab report in the standard format. 

These are the questions that should be included in your lab report:



*   What surfacing did you use and why? Make sure to talk to about cost, safety, accessibility, and age appropriateness.
*   What safety considerations did you take into account when creating your playground?
*   Why did you choose specific equipment? Include deck/platform heights and spacing of equipment related to age group.
*   What did you learn about using different materials through this project?
*   How much did you spend for your project?
*   How did you use the engineering design process when coming up with the design of your playground?
*   How could your design be improved in the future?
*   What did you learn about Biological Engineering through this project?
