### Overview

Following the steps of the engineering design process and acting as robotics engineer, student teams will use drinking straws to design and build a robotic hand. This robotic hand will mimic the way human fingers work: tendons bend the fingers while the muscles in the forearm control the action.

### Outcomes

* To understand the physiology of the human hand and learn how human fingers work. 

* To apply the engineering design process to design a working hand.

* To design and build a working hand out of craft materials that demonstrates how a real robot hand might work.
 
#### NGSS Standards

* HS-LS1-2  Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms.
 
### NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas

* HS.LS1A.b  Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous parts and is itself a component of the next level.
