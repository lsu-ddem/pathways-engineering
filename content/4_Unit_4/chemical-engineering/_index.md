### Overview

Batch processes in batch reactors (such as pots & pans, ovens, etc.) are used for preparing most gourmet foods in a food laboratory (kitchen). The reaction steps are preceded or followed by material or feed preparation in other auxiliary pieces of equipment, such as blenders, food processors, separators and heaters/coolers. A delicate balance between ingredients and spices (raw materials), timing, and processing (cooking) time must be achieved to bring out subtle flavors.
