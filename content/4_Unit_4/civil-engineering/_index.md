### Overview

In teams, students will act as civil engineers and build a segmental bridge model.  Instead of building it out of concrete, which is messy and needs a few weeks to harden, they will use Styrofoam.  Styrofoam is a weaker material than concrete, so instead of having to use special steel cables, a small diameter bungee cord will do.

### Outcomes
Build a model segmental bridge and test the model to understand some behavior attributes of segmental bridges such as deflection. 
 
### NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas
ETS.HS.1C.a  Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones that can be approached systematically, and decisions about the priority of certain criteria over others (trade-offs) may be needed. 
 
### Common Core Standards
 8.F.B.5  Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is increasing or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the qualitative features of a function that has been described verbally.
