### Overview

Acting as industrial engineers, student teams will conduct a time and motion study of a simple assembly (bridge base).  

This project emphasizes the importance of reducing wasteful motions in order to reduce injury, fatigue and to increase productivity. The students should be able to complete the majority of the work, including the lab report and the poster, during class time.

### Outcomes 
* To practice conducting a time and motion study of a simple assembly (Bridge Base).

* To understand the importance of reducing the number of wasteful motions to increase productivity, reduce fatigue and possible injury. 

### NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas

* ETS.HS.1A.a  Criteria and constraints also include satisfying any requirements set by society, such as taking issues of risk mitigation into account, and they should be quantified to the extent possible and stated in such a way that one can tell if a given design meets them.

* ETS.HS.1C.a  Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones that can be approached systematically, and decisions about the priority of certain criteria over others (trade-offs) may be needed.
