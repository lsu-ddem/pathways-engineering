## <a href="http://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/connor/1_lesson_1/" target="_blank">Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes)</a>

### Outcomes 
* Learn how design impacts product performance

* Understand the difference in an innovation and an invention

* Identify and describe the parts of the engineering design process

## <a href="http://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/connor/2_lesson_2/2018-08-13-unit-1---lesson-2/" target="_blank">Lesson 2 (150-180 minutes)</a>

### Outcomes 
* Use the engineering design process to solve the problem

* Employ the use of data collection and analysis to help solve the problem

* Explain the reasons for their selected designs and material choices

### NGSS Standards
* HS-ETS1-2  Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

*HS-ETS1-3  Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts.
 
### NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas
* ETS.HS.1B.a  When evaluating solutions it is important to take into account a range of constraints including cost, safety, reliability and aesthetics and to consider social, cultural and environmental impacts.  

* ETS.HS.1B.b  Both physical models and computers can be used in various ways to aid in the engineering design process. 
 
### Common Core Standards
* RST.11-12.9  Synthesize information from a range of sources (e.g., texts, experiments, simulations) into a coherent understanding of a process, phenomenon, or concept, resolving conflicting information when possible. 

* SL.9-10.4  Present information, findings, and supporting evidence clearly, concisely, and logically such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to purpose, audience, and task

* W.9-10.4  Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
