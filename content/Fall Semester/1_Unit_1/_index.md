### [Lesson 1 (30-60 minutes)](https://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/1_unit_1/1_lesson_1/)

In this lesson students will take a survey and a pre-test to determine prior knowledge. After, this lesson will go over the overall format of the class, the syllabus and classroom policies. This lesson will also teach students what engineering is and what engineers do.

#### Outcomes

- Discuss the overall format of the class

- Define engineering and what engineers do

- Describe what some engineering disciplines do

- Enumerate several career paths for engineers

### [Lesson 2 (150-180 minutes)](https://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/1_unit_1/1_lesson_1/)

This lesson will teach students about ethical decision making through hands on projects.

#### Outcomes

- Demonstrate an understanding of academic honesty ethics, and ethics pertaining to the profession of engineer

- Gain a better understanding of the variety of factors that influence and cloud a person's judgement when faced with an ethical dilemma

- Understand the bases for making ethical decisions

- Analyze and debate multiple solutions to an ethical dilemma, determine the best alternative available, and describe how the decision maximizes the benefit and minimizes the risk for everyone involved

#### Common Core Standards

| Common Core Standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Student Action                                                                                                                   |

| SL.9-10.1.C Propel conversations by posing and responding to questions that relate the current discussion to broader themes or larger ideas; actively incorporate others into the discussion; and clarify, verify, or challenge ideas and conclusions.          | Students work in groups to read engineering case studies and evaluate each scenario using the Steps for Ethical Decision Making. |
| RST.11-12.9 Synthesize information from a range of sources (e.g., texts, experiments, simulations) into a coherent understanding of a process, phenomenon, or concept, resolving conflicting information when possible.                                         | Students work in groups to read engineering case studies and evaluate each scenario using the Steps for Ethical Decision Making. |
| SL.9-10.4 Present information, findings, and supporting evidence clearly, concisely, and logically such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to purpose, audience, and task. | Student groups share results and decisions regarding case studies with the rest of the class.                                    |

### [Lesson 3 (30 minutes)](./3_lesson_3/)
