| RST.11-12.9, Synthesize information from a range of sources (e.g., texts, experiments, simulations) into a coherent understanding of a process, phenomenon, or concept, resolving conflicting information when possible                                         | Students use information from the Super Slinger Handout, presentation, and independent research to design their Super Slinger model. |
| SL.9-10.4, Present information, findings, and supporting evidence clearly, concisely, and logically such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to purpose, audience, and task | Students develop and deliver a presentation to communicate the results of the Super Slinger Project.                                 |
| W.9-10.4, Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.                                                                                                                  | Students write a lab report to communicate the results of the Super Slinger Project.                                                 |
