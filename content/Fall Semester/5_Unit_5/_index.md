### [Lesson 1 (165 minutes)](https://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/fall-semester/5_unit_5/1_lesson_1/)

This lesson introduces students to the basics of a circuit and then students research and present on common components of a circuit

#### Outcomes

- Understand common components of a circuit

### [Lesson 2 (110 minutes)](https://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/fall-semester/5_unit_5/2_lesson_2/)

Students create a physical circuit that will light up an LED using an Arduino microcontroller, explore a variety of resistors to understand the role that resistors play in the circuit, and calculate current for their circuit.

#### Outcomes

- Define an open circuit, closed circuit, and a short circuit
- Identify the primary components of a circuit
- Use Ohmâ€™s Law to calculate current with given resistor and voltage values
- List the advantages of using a breadboard during circuit design.

#### NGSS Standards

| NGSS Standard                                                                                                                                                                                              	| Student Action                                                             	|

| ETS.HS.1C.a Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones that can be approached systematically, and decisions about the priority of certain criteria over others (trade-offs) may be needed. 	| Students follow specific steps to use Arduinos to build a physical circuit to light up an LED light. 	|

### [Lesson 3 (135 minutes)](https://intro-to-engineering-design.lsupathways.org/fall-semester/5_unit_5/3_lesson_3/)

Students use Arduinos to create a circuit to light and LED and manipulate the code to set specific blinking patterns. 

#### Outcomes

- Understand the role of a computer scientist when it comes to working with computers
- Blink an LED on an Arduino at a given rate.
- Create a specific blinking pattern such as mimicking a heartbeat or representing a message encoded in Morse code.
