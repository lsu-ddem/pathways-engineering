| HS-ETS1-2 Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.                                                                                                           	| Students work in groups to follow specific guidelines and constraints to complete the Fluor Challenge. 	|
| HS-ETS1-3 Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts. 	| Students work in groups to follow specific guidelines and constraints to complete the Fluor Challenge. 	|

| RST.11-12.9 Synthesize information from a range of sources (e.g., texts, experiments, simulations) into a coherent understanding of a process, phenomenon, or concept, resolving conflicting information when possible.                                        	| Students use information from the Fluor Challenge Handout, presentation, and independent research. 	|
| SL.9-10.4 Present information, findings, and supporting evidence clearly, concisely, and logically such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to purpose, audience, and task 	| Students develop and deliver a presentation to communicate the results of the Fluor Challenge.     	|
| W.9-10.4 Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.                                                                                                                  	| Students write a lab report to communicate the results of the Fluor Challenge.                     	|
