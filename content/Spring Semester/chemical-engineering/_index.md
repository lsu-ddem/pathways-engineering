### Overview

Batch processes in batch reactors (such as pots & pans, ovens, etc.) are used for preparing most gourmet foods in a food laboratory (kitchen). The reaction steps are preceded or followed by material or feed preparation in other auxiliary pieces of equipment, such as blenders, food processors, separators and heaters/coolers. A delicate balance between ingredients and spices (raw materials), timing, and processing (cooking) time must be achieved to bring out subtle flavors.

| HSN.Q.A.2 Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.                          | Students calculate and report quantities of each ingredient in their recipe to develop their process flow diagram.                        |
| HSN.Q.A.3 Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities. | Students determine appropriate measures and necessary rounding for each ingredient in their recipe to develop their process flow diagram. |
