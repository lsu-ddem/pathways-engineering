### Overview
Students will work with Arduinoâ€™s to create a circuit that lights up an LED.  After building the circuit, students will act like computer scientists to manipulate the light bulb to blink at different rates.  Students will then add additional lights to their circuit and create specific blink patterns. 

### Outcomes
* Understand the role of a computer scientist when it comes to working with computers
* Blink an LED on an Arduino at a given rate.
* Create a specific blinking pattern such as mimicking a heartbeat or representing a message encoded in Morse code.
