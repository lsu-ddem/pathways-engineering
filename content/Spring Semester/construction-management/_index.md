### Overview
Acting as construction managers, students will develop a bid that includes a cost for materials and an estimated schedule for a small object (created by another team) and build it. Teams will only be able to communicate with the client using a request for information.

| ETS.HS.1A.a Criteria and constraints also include satisfying any requirements set by society, such as taking issues of risk mitigation into account, and they should be quantified to the extent possible and stated in such a way that one can tell if a given design meets them. | Students consider various criteria and constraints including time, cost, design preferences to complete the request for information project. |
