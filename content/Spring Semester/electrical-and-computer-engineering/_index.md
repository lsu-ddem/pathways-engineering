### Overview

Now that students have a basic understanding of circuits, teams will create parallel and series circuits.  They will understand the circuits behavior based on the type of wiring.  Students will also explore the use of a physical switch in a circuit. 

### Outcomes

* Build a parallel and series circuit using a breadboard
* Understand and identify parallel and series circuits. 
* Explain the benefits and drawbacks to each type of circuit. 
* Identify where each type of circuit may be used.

| HS-PS3-5. Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction. | Students use Arduinos to build a physical circuit to light up an LED light in parallel and in series. |
