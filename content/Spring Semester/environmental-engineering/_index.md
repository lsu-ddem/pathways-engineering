### Overview
Students will work in teams of “environmental engineers” to analyze an "oil spill" in the classroom, then design and test systems to contain and remove the oil from the water. Students will decide on which everyday items/materials they will use and how they will recover the oil from the water. After testing the clean-up materials selected they will analyze the different methods and determine the most efficient way to contain and clean up an oil spill. As part of the analysis, students will test material’s effectivity to clean up oil both before and after the use of dispersants (i.e. dish soap). Students will compare the results of the before and after dispersant test and record their observations on the Student Handout.

### Outcomes
* To analyze and examine methods used to clean-up oil spills.

* To test different clean-up methods and determine their effectiveness. 

* To explain benefits and drawbacks (tradeoffs) for each particular method.
