### Overview
This design activity explores the engineering behind the conveyor belt and considers the impact this invention has had on transportation and the coordinated shipping and delivery of goods.
 
Students work in teams to design and build a conveyor system given a limited number of materials. They will create a working conveyor that moves items 4 feet, with a 90 degree turn.Student teams design their system, build and test it, evaluate
their designs and those of classmates, and share observations with their class.
