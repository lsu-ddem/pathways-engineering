### Overview

Students will design a model to demonstrate how hydraulic fracturing aids in extracting oil and gas from shale deposits thousands of feet beneath the earthâ€™s surface. In teams, they will work to customize and improve drilling models.
 
### Outcomes

Students will understand that horizontal drilling allows for more surface area of host rocks to be fracked after designing a model that demonstrates hydraulic fracturing methods.

| HS-ESS3-1 Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity. 	| Students model a human response to availability of natural resources through the hydraulic fracturing project. 	|
| HS-ESS3-2 Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios.                                          	| Students consider and test potential adjustments to their model in the hydraulic fracturing project.           	|
| HS-ESS3-4 Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.                                                                        	| Students consider and test potential adjustments to their model in the hydraulic fracturing project.           	|
